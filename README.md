# Police Station Simulation

This project is part of the Data Simulation Lab in my 4th semester Bachelor's program.

 It is a Real-Time Environment project where priorities are based on the type and severity of the crime. Cases are handled accordingly, with MLA cases having the highest priority so both Priority and Preemptive Resources are used in this system. There is a record of all police officers, and all the cases handled by them are recorded. Police officers work on a shift basis.
